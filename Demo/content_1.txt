Website Content Ideas
Project Title
Regenerative Renaissance
Spirit / Vision
This isn’t an environmental campaign — it’s an earthly renaissance.
We are no longer merely a “learning platform.”
We are a living, breathing digital habitat — one with warmth and soul.
Rigid functional modules have been re-woven into an immersive narrative rich in time and space. The website is no longer a cold database; it is an organism that shifts with the real world — dawn and dusk, clean air or haze.
Here, knowledge becomes a journey.
Data carries emotion.
Technology becomes a medium for restoring the human heart to nature.
________________________________________
Course Structure
The platform will feature four thematic course zones, each distinguished by a unique color.
During the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) phase, only the Green Zone and Blue Zone will be launched initially.
Content Formats
●	Articles
●	Stories combined with scientific explanations
●	Eco-Pulse short-form videos (immersive interactive videos, interviews, and cinematic storytelling)
Video Experience
Not just watching nature — but “touching” it.
This is not traditional, monotonous educational video content. Instead, it delivers a cinematic experience comparable to high-quality Netflix documentaries.
Cinematic Visuals
●	A curated collection of high-production-value ecological short films
●	Topics include Taiwan’s endemic species, climate change, and environmental aesthetics
●	Each video is 2–5 minutes long, designed for modern, fragmented viewing habits
“Exploration Hotspots” Interactive Mechanism
During video playback, subtle glowing “eco-hotspots” appear on screen.
When clicked:
●	The video pauses automatically
●	A beautifully designed knowledge card pops up
○	e.g., the behavior of a rare bird species
○	or a microscopic visualization of air pollution
Learning happens precisely at the moment curiosity arises.
Seamless Streaming Technology
Whether on mobile or desktop, the system automatically adjusts video quality based on network speed, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted playback.
Engagement & Missions
Knowledge Missions
●	Watch designated videos
●	Discover all hidden hotspots
●	Pass short quizzes guided by an AI mentor
Action Missions
●	Invite friends to join
●	Maintain consecutive log-ins to track environmental data
Website Structure & Interaction Design
The website adopts a vertical scrolling experience
(Reference: https://www.jazakvoda.rs/)
Phase One: The Atmospheric Start (MVP – not yet included)
Purple Zone: Air & Stars
Visual Experience
Upon entering the website, the user’s viewpoint is positioned at the highest peak of a Norwegian fjord (photo-realistic background blended with illustration).
The scene is not static — it flows slowly.
●	Daytime: open sky with drifting clouds
●	Nighttime: a deep purple starry sky with moving mist
●	Visuals dynamically change based on time zones and real-world climate conditions
As the experience begins, text gradually emerges — including carbon cycle data visualized in an elegant, poetic way.
Purple Zone (Air / Stars)
An illustrated traveler holds a lantern, gazing at text and carbon-cycle data drifting across the starry sky like cosmic dust.
Core Interaction: The Wayfarer
Illustrated Guide
A hand-drawn character, warm and human, is layered onto real photographic landscapes.
Scroll-to-Walk
As the user scrolls down, the illustrated traveler moves along canyon edges or pathways.
(Alternatively, the character can follow the cursor.)
Scene Transitions
Scene transitions: As the character walks, text expressing the “core values” will appear naturally along the path like signposts. When entering the next scene, the wayfarer may also display speech bubbles (for example: “Welcome to the forest”).
Experience Design
The user is not browsing a website — they are following a guide deep into nature.
Modular Journey & Atmosphere
As the traveler advances, users pass through four core modules, each with its own:
●	Unique music
●	Distinct atmosphere and emotional tone
Camera Movement
As scrolling continues:
●	Clouds recede
●	The camera transitions from a cosmic, star-overlooking perspective
●	Into a dynamic descent toward Earth
Sound Design
Background ambient sound can be freely toggled on or off.
Living Night Sky (as in the figure below)
The night sky subtly rotates.
Different stars can represent the number of users currently online, creating the feeling that many others are present in this shared moment.

Phase Two: Course Exploration (The Ecological Descent)
Zones: Green, Blue, and Orange (Priority for MVP)
In this phase, the experience will adopt vertical perspective (Z-Axis) to give users the sensation of descending through the Earth’s layers as they scroll.
“Exploration Hotspots” Interactive Mechanism
During exploration, flickering “eco hotspots” will appear on screen. For example, in the Green Forest Zone:
●	Illustrations of small animals may emerge in the environment.
●	As users scroll down, flowers may bloom in the scene.
●	When users click these hotspots, beautifully designed knowledge cards will pop up with contextual information — for example, explaining the behavior of a rare bird species or introducing particular plants.
Core Interaction: The Wayfarer
The illustrated guide — a hand-drawn character — is superimposed on real photographic backgrounds.
 Scroll-to-Walk: As users scroll downward, the illustrated character moves along forest trails or terrain.
 (Optionally, the character may also follow the cursor.)
Scene Transitions
As the wayfarer walks, text representing the core values of the project will naturally appear along the path like signposts.
Experience Feel
Users are not simply browsing a webpage —
 they are journeying with a guide into the depths of nature.
As the illustrated character advances, users will pass through four core module zones, each accompanied by its own unique music and atmosphere.
Territorial Zones (Color Regions)
 Purple Zone: Stars & Atmosphere
(Not included in MVP)
 Visual Experience:
 When users enter the site, their viewpoint begins at the highest peak of a Norwegian canyon, with a photographic background blended with illustration. The environment is not static, but gently moving:
●	Daytime sky with drifting clouds
●	At night, a deep purple starry sky with drifting fog
●	Scene dynamics may adjust based on time zones and climate
As the introduction unfolds, text and carbon cycle data begin to float into view.
 Potential course topics: celestial navigation, atmospheric science, and cosmology.
Here are some potential future content ideas I’ve come up with so far, though for now we recommend focusing on science-oriented content.
Climate Change: featuring carbon sequestration data.
Stratospheric Ozone Depletion: Atmospheric monitoring data highlighting global collaborative success stories.
Green Zone: Forest
Users walk among towering trees with sunlight filtering through leaves. The forest space allows layered illustrations to be brought in — e.g., rivers appearing to guide users into related knowledge or ecological content.
Here are some potential future content ideas I’ve come up with so far, though for now we recommend focusing on science-oriented content.
Potential topics include:
●	Life cycles
●	Carbon sequestration
●	Photosynthesis
●	CO₂ absorption efficiency
●	Global forest history
●	River ecology and related knowledge
Orange Zone: Eco-Hub (Regenerative Farm)
(Not included in MVP)
 View descends to the red earth of Kenya. A vertical ecological cross-section illustrates transitions from forest trees to agroforestry, soil layers, water cycles, and carbon cycles.
Potential topics include:
●	Regenerative agriculture
●	Wild vegetable cuisine
●	Soil restoration
●	Water cycling and carbon land-system change
●	How mixed-forest agriculture can halt desertification and support rain gardens
●	Loss of biosphere integrity: Biodiversity protection and species recovery
●	Nitrogen and phosphorus flows: Addressing industrial fertilizer pollution and promoting regenerative organic soil nutrient cycling
●	Freshwater consumption: Rainwater harvesting systems and wastewater cycling technologies in eco communities
Blue Zone: Ocean
The screen instantly shifts to blue. Users feel as if they are following the water cycle and “diving” beneath the waves, with sunlight forming patterns on the water surface.
Here are some potential future content ideas I’ve come up with so far, though for now we recommend focusing on science-oriented content.
Potential topics include:
●	Marine life
●	Blue carbon initiatives
●	The water cycle
●	Mangroves and coral ecosystems
●	Ocean acidification: How CO₂ alters pH levels and affects coral reefs
Phase Three: Future City & The Campfire Sync
Future City (Bottom of Page)
Scrolling Experience
From the ocean scene, users scroll down into a futuristic city that blends vegetation and architecture.
Visual Experience:
 Course modules appear like works of art, emerging irregularly from walls or shelves as though “growing” from the architecture itself.
Core topics include:
●	Sustainable fashion
●	Urban forests or pocket forests
●	Aesthetics of living and art
●	Rain gardens
Chemical Pollution & Novel Entities: Exploring how sustainable fashion eliminates synthetic fibers and microplastics by using natural materials like flax.
 Atmospheric Aerosols: How urban forests filter particulate matter and improve air quality.
Final Destination: The Campfire Sync
Scrolling Pattern
A centripetal motion brings all color zone elements together at the center of the screen, forming a living campfire.
Interactive Details:
1.	The illustrated wayfarer sits by the fire.
2.	The firelight flickers in sync with real-time wind speed data from Kenya.
3.	Users can engage in social interaction around the campfire.
Across the Entire Website
Core UI Elements
Throughout the website, the interface will include persistent navigational and progress elements such as:
●	A quick navigation map in the lower-left corner
●	A progress bar
●	Badges
●	Symbiotic Soul
●	On the right side, an indicator showing the current page number (users can also jump to any section)
Lower-Left Corner: Quick Navigation Map
In the bottom left corner, there will be a quick navigation map displaying the four major zones. This helps users feel a sense of achievement in “exploring the territory” and supports a modular presentation of different courses. In this area we can also show:
●	Course progress bar
●	Points
●	Badges
●	Symbiotic Soul (suggested to be an animal avatar)
●	Air data and other environmental metrics
Symbiotic Soul: animals
A digital avatar that is linked to the environment
●	A digital companion that breathes the same air as the user.
●	We transform boring environmental data (Data) into emotional and empathetic connections (Empathy).
●	Custom ecological avatar: When users register, they can generate an animal based on their MBTI type.
Call-to-Action (CTA)
The animal can speak in dialogue bubbles to guide users to courses, for example:
“The forest is dimming because of lack of oxygen — your first lesson can bring back the sunlight.”
Real-Time AQI Sync (Core Innovation)
The Symbiotic Soul responds to the user’s local Air Quality Index (AQI):
●	Good air: The companion glows brightly, moves energetically, and even causes flowers to bloom.
●	Poor air: The companion appears dull, curled up, or indicates it needs care.
●	If a user hasn’t visited for a long time, the animal may grow moss (e.g., a sloth with moss on its back).
Environmental Awareness Alerts
When environmental data fluctuates significantly, the companion may send push notifications to remind users to pay attention and provide suggestions for improvement.
Dynamic Badge Wall
Users earn beautifully designed digital badges for completing tasks (e.g., “Forest Guardian”, “Knowledge Explorer”). These badges are more than images — they represent the user’s environmental impact and identity within the community.
Eco-Points System
Every interaction earns Eco-Points, which can be used to unlock special Symbiotic Soul costumes or background themes, making the user’s digital avatar more unique.
Right-Side Navigation
On the right side of the screen, there should be a current page indicator (with user-controlled jump navigation). This functions like a menu or index so that users don’t have to scroll the entire long page when they simply want to revisit a specific course section.
Possible implementations include:
●	Quick map overview
●	Index navigation menu
This is especially helpful when users want to quickly review or skip to a specific course segment without scrolling through the whole page.
Gaia’s Wisdom: AI Ecological Guide
Persistent Support in the Lower Right
An AI guide (or footprints/guide icon) will be shown in the lower right corner.
Always on standby, ready to answer your questions about “why” — and explain with warmth and accuracy.
Intelligent & Knowledgeable
Unlike generic chatbots, Gaia is trained with carefully verified authoritative environmental science knowledge. Whether you ask:
●	“Why do sea turtles eat plastic?”
●	“What is a carbon tax?”
 Gaia provides accurate, clear, and easy-to-understand answers — never nonsense.
Extended Learning Recommendations
After watching a video, the AI will proactively suggest related in-depth articles or the next short film based on user interests — helping users seamlessly continue their learning journey.
Gentle Guidance
Gaia is designed to be an encouraging mentor, not a cold encyclopedia.
Additional Ideas (need further discussion on placement)
Equipment & Outfit Points Exchange Shop:
Users can use their accumulated points to redeem equipment and clothing.
 Top three users with the highest annual points could receive airline tickets as rewards.
Examples of redeemable items:
●	Classic Explorer Gear: 19th-century naturalist equipment (leather satchel, brass telescope, beret)
●	Kenyan Weavings: Colorful shawls, beads, and woven necklaces inspired by traditional female craftwork
Daily Knowledge Card Draw:
A daily card draw that presents:
●	One new piece of knowledge
●	A mood prompt or micro-insight
Design:
 A stack of illustrated cards is displayed. Clicking flips a card with a crisp page-turn sound.
 Examples of content:
●	A small suggestion for a sustainable habit
●	A hidden lucky bonus, e.g., “Today the Kenyan farm has sunny skies — double XP today.”
Night Watchman Radio:
A vintage vinyl record player interface.
●	Website background music playlist links to Spotify, apple music
●	podcast episodes
Online Gallery Exhibition:
A digital gallery showcasing:
●	User photos or artwork
●	Creative content from course-assigned missions
In the future, this could link to real-world physical gallery exhibitions.
Magazine-Style Web Stories / Course Features:
Web content or courses could be presented in a magazine format with themed features.
Example magazine headlines:
●	This Week’s Terroir: Plant stories from a specific Kenyan farm
●	Echo Notes: Late-night reflections with jazz
●	Sloth’s Slow Observations: Climate news with humorous short commentaries
FYI  from our business consultant :  "Prioritize MVP: Build core modules first; defer advanced features (e.g., full multi-language content production or complex gamification). Outsource non-critical tasks (e.g., initial UI/UX polishing) to freelancers. I have a contact that can support on this. I have a trusted friend who specializes in SaaS/web development for sustainability/edtech projects. She has experience with cost-efficient builds using scalable cloud tools (e.g., AWS/GCP for AQI integration). I can connect you for a consultation—potentially saving on dev compared to full in-house. Let me know if you'd like an intro."
1/19 Update: To discuss whether these should be Included in the MVP
Before Login
Consider whether there should be an entry landing page that users see before logging in. This page could include:
●	Website vision and mission
●	Website introduction (text, video, or animation)
●	FAQ / Support
●	Login / Sign-up
●	User success stories
●	Language selection (for MVP, we recommend English only initially, with more languages added later)
Main Purpose:
 To quickly capture users’ attention within the first 30 seconds, communicate the core value of the site, and guide users toward signing up. We can also discuss if and when to prompt users to create an account (free registration).
Reducing “Loading Anxiety” (Designer View)
Problem:
If a page loads slowly, users may feel impatient or uncertain about what’s happening. Classic spinners can feel boring and uninspiring.
Suggestion:
Instead of a generic spinning icon, create an interactive loading animation that reflects the theme — for example:
 “From stardust to seed, from sky to earth.”
 This way, users begin to engage with the experience even while waiting.
Below the animation, show a warm micro-copy line such as:
“Connecting your frequency with the Earth...”
Loading Animation Script
0% – 30% (Nebula Convergence):
●	The screen starts black.
●	A deep purple nebula slowly rotates and converges, with tiny star-like light particles flickering.
●	The Earth gradually appears in the distance.
●	Background cosmic ambient sound plays.
●	Micro-copy: “Connecting your frequency with the Earth...”
30% – 70% (Descent & Condensation):
●	Light particles begin to fall downward, symbolizing descent (hinting at a transition from the Purple Zone).
●	These particles condense into the outline of a glowing “guide” holding a lantern.
●	Micro-copy: “Searching for your landing point...”
70% – 100% (Touchdown & Germination):
●	The guide lands and soil texture appears beneath their feet.
●	Lantern light touches the ground, a glowing seed bursts forth, quickly growing into a dew-covered sprout (echoing the Green Zone).
●	guided dialogue: “Ready to breathe?” Or “From the atmosphere above, we see two bright gems — emerald forests and sapphire seas. Your journey begins with restoring them.”
Completion:
●	The sprout’s glow expands and transitions into the homepage, prompting the user to create an account.
Pitch Suggestions for the Loading Sequence
●	Around 20 seconds, reveal a powerful, impactful statistic to hook the user, e.g.: “Did you know? In the time it took you to read this sentence, an area of forest the size of X soccer fields has disappeared. But here, you can make a difference.”
Around 30 seconds, display a strong tagline, such as: “This isn’t a game — it’s a pact with your future.”
After this, transition seamlessly to the homepage and then to the initial onboarding or assessment page.
Alternate Loading Version:
●	A sky with floating clouds
●	Company mission / short introductory text
________________________________________
Member Area (After Login)
Homepage
First-Time Visitors:Must complete an MBTI-based assessment
When users finish the final question:
●	Generate the user’s MBTI animal avatar (e.g., a blue-glowing agile dolphin, or a calm glowing sloth).
●	A banner appears with the text: “Found it. This is your Symbiotic Soul.”
AQI Sync Interaction:
●	The avatar says: “Connected to your local air quality (AQI 75). Your companion is breathing the same air as you. It feels a bit dull.”
●	The avatar’s mood, movement, and glow change based on AQI status — e.g., slower motion, dimmer glow when air quality is poor.
Suggested narrative prompts:
●	“It needs cleaner air to evolve.”, “Below, the forest and ocean await restoration.”, “Descend with it into the Green Zone.”
